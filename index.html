    <h1> About Shaya </h1>
    <p>Welcome to my page! I love to garden, go camping, and dance. Sometimes I will do all three at the same time.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about caring for animals and have a cat named Mia and a dog named Samson. But my pride and joy is my chinchilla Frank Chinnatra.</p>
    <p>Creativity is a <strong>big</strong> part of my life, mainly writing and music, but I enjoy painting and drawing as well. </p>
    <p>One of my new favorite mediums to work with is Lego blocks, I just feel really bring my art to life with those little blocks.</p>
    <p> When I am not working in my garden or dancing, you can find me cuddled up with my fur babies watching Power Puff Girls.</p>
